## Introduction

This project appears to be a collection of Python scripts demonstrating various functionalities, including user authentication, basic bank operations, and a simple calculator. It showcases fundamental programming concepts and provides examples of how to build interactive command-line applications.

## Features

*   **User Authentication:** Implements user registration and login functionality.
*   **Bank Operations:** Provides a menu-driven interface for basic bank operations (withdrawal, deposit, complaint).
*   **Calculator:** Offers a simple calculator with addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.
*   **Data Storage:** Includes basic file-based data storage for user records.

## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>  # Replace <repository_url> with the actual repository URL
    cd pythonclass
    ```

3.  **No dependencies are required** as the project uses only built-in Python modules.

## Usage

### Authentication and Bank Operations (appone.py, appone\_updated.py, auth.py)

1.  Run the `auth.py` script:

    ```bash
    python auth.py
    ```

2.  Follow the prompts to register a new user or log in with an existing account.
3.  After successful login, you can access the bank operations menu.

### Calculator (calculator.py)

1.  Run the `calculator.py` script:

    ```bash
    python calculator.py
    ```

2.  Enter two numbers and select an operation from the menu.

### Example: Login and Bank Operations (auth.py)

```python
# Example from auth.py (simplified)
import auth

auth.init() # Starts the authentication process
```

### Example: Calculator Usage (calculator.py)

```python
# Example from calculator.py (simplified)
import calculator

# The calculator script will prompt for input and perform calculations.
```
