## Usage

### User Authentication (appone.py)

To use the user authentication feature:

1.  Run the `appone.py` file.
2.  The script will prompt you for your name and password.
3.  Enter the credentials. If the login is successful, a welcome message will be displayed.

```python
# Example usage (appone.py)
# Assuming you have appone.py in your current directory
# Run the script from your terminal
# python appone.py
```

### Bank Operations (appone_updated.py)

To use the bank operations feature:

1.  Run the `appone_updated.py` file.
2.  The script will present a menu of available options.
3.  Select an option by entering the corresponding number.

```python
# Example usage (appone_updated.py)
# Assuming you have appone_updated.py in your current directory
# Run the script from your terminal
# python appone_updated.py
```

### Calculator (calculator.py)

To use the calculator:

1.  Run the `calculator.py` file.
2.  The script will prompt you for two numbers and an operator.
3.  Enter the values and select the operation. The result will be displayed.

```python
# Example usage (calculator.py)
# Assuming you have calculator.py in your current directory
# Run the script from your terminal
# python calculator.py
```

### Authentication and Bank Operations (auth.py)

To use the combined authentication and bank operations:

1.  Run the `auth.py` file.
2.  The script will prompt you to either register or login.
3.  Follow the on-screen instructions.

```python
# Example usage (auth.py)
# Assuming you have auth.py in your current directory
# Run the script from your terminal
# python auth.py
```
